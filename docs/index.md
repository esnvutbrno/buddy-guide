# Welcome, buddy!

<div align="center">What’s up, buds! What you are reading now is a guide to the world of never-ending adventures, crazy stories, but also an ordinary everyday experience of an ESN buddy. You might be asking yourself **„What does it actually mean to be a good buddy?“**, and this guide will definitely help you to find the practical part of the answer. Nevertheless, you can skip it completely and still be a good buddy. A great buddy! All you need to do is to make sure you will be having fun all the way throughout your ESN experience.</div>


<div align="center">You joined our buddy program for some reason. Whatever it might be, I bet it must include at least a bit of a thirst for some international contact. And here you have an opportunity to engage with a new culture, practice your language skills, and have friends all around the world. Also, remember that your help can make someone else‘s day really awesome. As cliche as it sounds, spreading love and kindness is one of the most wonderful things human beings can do. And we are all part of a great community that creates the best experience for both Erasmus students as well as our members.</div>
